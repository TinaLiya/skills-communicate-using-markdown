##### :revolving_hearts: Seduction - with the purring method :
- [ ] Relax yourself
- [ ] Remember when you were a baby padding for milk and do so on a soft plushy surface
- [ ] When you feel the purr coming in your throat, let it sing
- [ ] Now, your human is probably already cooing at you right now, if not, keep your sweet purr song and go cuddle your face against your human legs or hands depending on their emplacement
- [ ] Remember : they are usually with a phone in hand, or clapping on their laptop thingy, when they stop to concentrate on you, it's a win ! :trophy:
